2. **Thread Safety**: Ensuring robust operation in a multi-threaded environment while maintaining responsiveness. We implemented appropriate synchronization and resource management.

3. **False Positive Reduction**: Developing strategies to minimize false alarms while maintaining detection sensitivity. Our solution includes verification steps, confidence thresholds, and continuous learning.

4. **Seamless Integration**: Creating a plugin that works naturally within the Nx Meta ecosystem. We designed the interface to leverage existing Nx features like the Alarm Layout and event system.

## Deployment Considerations

For successful deployment, consider these recommendations:

1. **Hardware Requirements**: Ensure the server meets the recommended specifications, especially when running on multiple cameras.

2. **Camera Selection**: Choose cameras with good field of view, consistent lighting, and appropriate positioning for optimal results.

3. **Initial Configuration**: Take time to configure business hours, regions of interest, and sensitivity levels appropriate for each environment.

4. **Operator Training**: Ensure security personnel understand how to interpret and respond to different types of alerts.

5. **Periodic Review**: Schedule regular reviews of performance to refine settings and improve detection accuracy.
